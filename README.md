# protein-converter

What your project is/does (and what it's called):
My project is just called protein converter, and it converts DNA (coding & template stands)/mRNA into their corresponding proteins. It also saves the past 10 conversions in the history page.

Why you made your project:
honestly, I've been meaning to make one for a while and I just really love biology. I've always thought that making a DNA/mRNA to protein translator would be very cool, especially last year whan I spent forever looking at codon charts repeatedly.

How you made your project:
I made my project in VS Code using HTML, CSS, and JS. 

What you struggled with and what you learned:
I honestly struggled with a lot of things on this project. I can't lie, the history tab and the protein concatenation was driving me mad haha. It took forever to get the output printing what I wanted, every time I fixed something I felt like something else broke ðŸ˜­

Anyway, I learned how to make sliders in HTML and CSS! I really love the aesthetic and transition of the slider and will be incorporating it in the future.
